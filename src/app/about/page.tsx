            A Family Tradition of Natural Cooking
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            For three generations, our family has been committed to serving
            authentic dishes made with only natural ingredients. What started as
            a small family kitchen in 1985 has grown into a beloved
            establishment, but our principles remain unchanged.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Every dish we serve is made from scratch, using recipes passed down
            through generations and refined over decades of experience. We
            believe that real food doesn&apos;t need artificial enhancers to
            taste amazing.
